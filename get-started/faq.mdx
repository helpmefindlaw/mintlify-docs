  <Accordion title="4. Are you providing legal advice?">
    Absolutely not! Our goal is to use AI to connect users with legal information and automate workflows, not to offer legal advice. If you're not a legal professional, please seek legal advice before using any AI-generated output. See our [terms of service](https://www.lawme.ai/policies/terms-of-use) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. How accurate are your results?">
    Our AI is built on an extensive legal corpus, allowing it to self-educate and fact-check. This reduces the likelihood of errors or 'hallucinations'. However, AI isn't perfect, which is why we provide detailed citations for verification. We continuously improve our AI and welcome your feedback at [contact@lawme.ai](mailto:contact@lawme.ai).
  </Accordion>

    Paid users can reach our support team via email at [support@lawme.ai](mailto:support@lawme.ai) or join our Discord group for assistance.
