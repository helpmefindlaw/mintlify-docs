<Callout type="info">
  Batching allows you to process multiple items at the same time, making your workflows faster and more efficient.
</Callout>

## What is Batching?

Batching is like having multiple workers doing the same task simultaneously. In Lawme, you can turn any block into a "Batch" block to enable batching:

<Steps>
  1. Find the block you want to batch
  2. Look for the "Batch" toggle
  3. Turn the toggle on to enable batching
</Steps>

## How Batching Works

When you use batching:

<Card title="Multiple Executions" icon="clone">
  The block runs multiple times at once, each time with a different piece of information.
</Card>

<Card title="Input and Output" icon="exchange-alt">
  The block can take in lists of information and will give out lists of results.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexible Input" icon="puzzle-piece">
  If you give the block a single item and a list, it will use the single item for each run with the items from the list.

    Read multiple files at once
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Requests" icon="cloud">
    Send several requests simultaneously
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Analysis" icon="chart-bar">
    Analyze multiple data sets in parallel
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Generation" icon="file-word">
    Create multiple documents at the same time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Chaining Batched Blocks

You can connect batched blocks to create powerful workflows:

<Steps>
  1. Use a batched block to read multiple files
  2. Connect it to a batched Text block to process each file's content
  3. Then connect to a batched Chat block to analyze each processed file with AI
</Steps>

This setup allows you to process multiple files through several steps, all at the same time!

## Combining Results

After batching, you might want to bring all the results back together. Here are some ways to do that:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text and Prompt Blocks" icon="paragraph">
    Automatically join lists of text into one
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat Block" icon="comments">
    Can handle lists of messages or text
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extract Object Path" icon="sitemap">
    Pick out specific information from lists of data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pop Block" icon="hand-point-up">
    Get a single item from a list
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code Block" icon="code">
    Write custom code to combine results (for advanced users)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Lawme doesn't support batching within batching (nested batching). If you need more complex setups, consider using a batched Subflow Block, which allows for more flexibility.
</Warning>

By using batching in your workflows, you can make your legal processes much faster and more efficient, handling multiple tasks at once with ease.
