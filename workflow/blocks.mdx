Blocks are the essential elements of Lawme workflows. Whether you're building simple sequences or intricate logic, blocks help bring your workflows to life. Here's everything you need to know to add, arrange, and customise them.

## Adding a Block

To add a block, right-click in any empty space on the flow canvas (or press **Space**) to open the **Add Menu**.

</Frame>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Search & Select">
    Start typing to quickly find the block you need in the menu.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organised by Category">
    Blocks are grouped by category for easy browsing. Select a block to place it at the location you right-clicked.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For details on all available blocks, check out the [Block Reference](../../block-reference).

## Moving Blocks

Repositioning blocks is quick and easy:

- **Drag & Drop**: Click and hold the title bar of a block, then drag it to your desired position.
- **Multi-Select**: Hold **Shift** and click on multiple blocks to move them as a group.

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a block is permanent, and there's no undo option. Double-check before you delete!
</Callout>

## Connecting Blocks

Connections define the data flow between blocks. Here's how to link them:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Connections">
    Click and drag from an output port on one block to an input port on another. Outputs are on the right side, inputs are on the left.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Port Rules">
    Outputs can connect to multiple inputs, but each input can only connect to one output. Ensure data types match for smooth operation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For more details on port data types, refer to the [Block Reference](../../block-reference).

## Disconnecting Blocks

Need to adjust a connection? 

- **Move Connection**: Click and drag on a connected port to change the connection to a different port.
- **Delete Connection**: Drag the connection line to an empty space to remove it.

## Creating a Subflow

Subflows allow you to group blocks for cleaner, more manageable workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Blocks">
    Hold **Shift** and click on each block you want to include in the subflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Subflow">
    Right-click one of the selected blocks and choose **Create Subflow**. This action moves the selected blocks into a new (_unsaved!_) flow, complete with input and output blocks that link back to the main flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Name and describe your subflow in the flow info section to keep it organised. Don't forget to save with **CMD+S** or **CTRL+S**.
</Tip>

<Note>
  The original blocks in the parent flow remain in place, so you'll need to manually replace them with your subflow if desired.
</Note>

## Editing a Block
