<Callout type="info">
  Subflows are like building blocks that you can use to create larger, more complex workflows. They help you organize your work and make it easier to manage.
</Callout>

## What are Subflows?

Subflows are smaller workflows that you can use within larger workflows. Think of them as mini-processes that you can reuse in different parts of your main workflow.

<Card title="Main Flow" icon="diagram-project">
  Every workflow must have a main flow. This is the primary process that orchestrates all the other parts of your workflow.
</Card>

## How Subflows Work

1. You create a subflow as a separate, smaller workflow.
2. You can then use this subflow in your main workflow or other larger workflows.
3. When a subflow is used, it receives information (inputs) from the main workflow.
4. After the subflow completes its task, it sends back results (outputs) to the main workflow.

  <Card title="Outputs" icon="arrow-right-from-bracket">
    Results or processed information that the subflow sends back to the main workflow.

## Benefits of Using Subflows

By using subflows, you can build more efficient and organized workflows, making your legal processes smoother and easier to manage.
