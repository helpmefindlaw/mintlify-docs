<Callout type="info">
  Flows are the building blocks of your automated legal processes. They represent step-by-step procedures that use AI to streamline your work.
</Callout>

A workflow is made up of several flows. Each flow is like a visual map of a specific task or process, consisting of connected blocks that work together to accomplish your goals.

## Understanding Flows

Flows are designed to make your legal work easier and faster. They connect different actions (called "blocks") to create a smart process. The best part? You don't need to know how to code - you can build powerful AI workflows just by connecting these blocks!

Here's how a typical flow works:

1. It begins with starting blocks that kick off the process.
2. As each block completes its task, it passes information to the next connected blocks.
3. Blocks wait for all necessary information before they start working.
4. This process continues, with some blocks running at the same time when possible, until the entire flow is complete.

This design allows you to create sophisticated AI-powered processes, where one AI task leads to another, enabling complex decision-making and automation.

## Creating a New Flow

<Steps>
  1. Right-click in the empty space of the flow list in the sidebar
  2. Choose "New Flow" to start with a blank canvas
  3. Navigate to the **Flow Info** tab and give your flow a descriptive name
  4. Save your new flow by pressing **Ctrl+S** (or **Cmd+S** on Mac)
</Steps>

Your new flow will now appear in the list, ready for you to start building your AI-powered process.

## Switching Between Flows

To move between different flows, simply click on the flow name in the sidebar list. This will open the selected flow in the main workspace.

## Removing a Flow

<Warning>
  Deleting a flow cannot be undone. Please be sure before proceeding.
</Warning>

To remove a flow:
1. Right-click on the flow name in the sidebar list
2. Select "Delete Flow" from the menu that appears

## Flow Inputs and Outputs

Flows can receive information (inputs) and produce results (outputs). This makes them versatile and reusable in different situations.

### Adding Inputs

Use [Input Blocks](../../block-reference/input) to define what information your flow needs to start. Think of these as the questions your flow needs answered before it can begin.

### Adding Outputs

Use [Output Blocks](../../block-reference/output) to specify what results your flow should produce when it's finished.

<Tip>
  When designing flows, consider what key information your process needs to start (inputs) and what valuable insights or actions it should produce (outputs).
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Designing Flows

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic process and add more complexity as needed.
2. **Use Clear Names**: Give your flows and blocks descriptive names that explain their purpose.
3. **Add Explanations**: Use comments or notes to explain how your flow works.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the testing features to make sure your flow works correctly with different inputs.

By mastering flows, you'll be able to create powerful, AI-driven processes that automate complex legal tasks and make your work more efficient.
