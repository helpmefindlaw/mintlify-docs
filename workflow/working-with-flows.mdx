# Working with Flows

<Callout type="info">
  Flows are the heart of Lawme, representing business processes and AI-powered workflows that automate legal tasks.
</Callout>

A Lawme project contains a set of named flows. Each flow is a visual representation of a business process or AI chain, composed of interconnected blocks that work together to accomplish specific tasks.

## Understanding Flows

Flows in Lawme are designed to automate and streamline your legal processes. They work by connecting various blocks, each representing a specific action or decision point. Data flows from left to right through these blocks, allowing you to create complex, AI-powered workflows without needing to write code.

Here's how a typical flow might work:

1. It starts with blocks that don't have any inputs, called "root blocks".
2. As each block executes, it sends its output to all connected blocks.
3. A block waits for all its inputs before it can execute.
4. This process continues, with blocks running in parallel when possible, until the entire flow is complete.

This design allows you to create sophisticated AI chains, where the output of one AI interaction becomes the input for the next, enabling complex decision-making and task automation.

## Creating a Flow

<Steps>
  1. Right-click in the blank space of the flow list in the sidebar
  2. Select "New Flow" to create a blank flow
  3. Go to the **Flow Info** tab and give your flow a meaningful name
  4. Save the new flow by pressing **Ctrl+S** or **Cmd+S**
</Steps>

Your new flow will now appear in the flow list, ready for you to start building your AI-powered workflow.

## Navigating Between Flows

To switch between flows, simply click on the flow name in the sidebar's flow list. This will open the selected flow in the main workspace.

## Deleting a Flow

<Warning>
  Deleting a flow is permanent and cannot be undone. Please be certain before proceeding.
</Warning>

To delete a flow:
1. Right-click on the flow name in the sidebar's flow list
2. Select "Delete Flow" from the context menu

## Running a Flow

## Flow Inputs and Outputs

Flows can have inputs and outputs, allowing them to receive data and return results. This makes them flexible and reusable across different scenarios.

### Adding Inputs

Use [Input Blocks](../../block-reference/input) to define the data your flow needs to run. These act like parameters for your workflow.

### Adding Outputs

Use [Output Blocks](../../block-reference/output) to specify what results your flow should return after execution.

<Tip>
  When designing flows, think about the key information your workflow needs (inputs) and the valuable insights or actions it should produce (outputs).
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Flow Design

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic workflow and gradually add complexity as needed.
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Give your flows and blocks clear, meaningful names that reflect their purpose.
3. **Document Your Flow**: Use comments or documentation blocks to explain the purpose and logic of your workflow.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the live debugging feature to ensure your flow behaves as expected with various inputs.

By mastering flows in Lawme, you'll be able to create powerful, AI-driven workflows that automate complex legal tasks and boost your firm's efficiency.
