  Flows are the building blocks of your automated legal processes. They represent step-by-step procedures that use AI to streamline your work.
</Callout>

A workflow is made up of several flows. Each flow is like a visual map of a specific task or process, consisting of connected blocks that work together to accomplish your goals.

## Understanding Flows

Flows are designed to make your legal work easier and faster. They connect different actions (called "blocks") to create a smart process. The best part? You don't need to know how to code - you can build powerful AI workflows just by connecting these blocks!

Here's how a typical flow works:

1. It begins with starting blocks that kick off the process.
2. As each block completes its task, it passes information to the next connected blocks.
3. Blocks wait for all necessary information before they start working.
4. This process continues, with some blocks running at the same time when possible, until the entire flow is complete.

This design allows you to create sophisticated AI-powered processes, where one AI task leads to another, enabling complex decision-making and automation.

## Creating a New Flow

<Steps>
  1. Right-click in the empty space of the flow list in the sidebar
  2. Choose "New Flow" to start with a blank canvas
  3. Navigate to the **Flow Info** tab and give your flow a descriptive name
  4. Save your new flow by pressing **Ctrl+S** (or **Cmd+S** on Mac)
</Steps>

Your new flow will now appear in the list, ready for you to start building your AI-powered process.

## Switching Between Flows

To move between different flows, simply click on the flow name in the sidebar list. This will open the selected flow in the main workspace.
=======
  Flows are the cornerstone of Lawme, representing sophisticated business processes and AI-powered workflows that revolutionise legal task automation.
</Callout>

A Lawme project is a collection of multiple flows. Each flow serves as a visual representation of a legal task or process, constructed using interconnected blocks that collaborate to achieve specific outcomes.

## Understanding Flows

Flows in Lawme are designed to streamline and accelerate your legal work. They function as a chain of intelligent building blocks, with each block performing a specialised task. Information cascades through these blocks from left to right, enabling you to craft smart, AI-powered workflows without any coding expertise.

Here's a simplified model of how a flow operates:

1. It initiates with "starter" blocks that require no input to begin.
2. As each block completes its task, it transmits its results to the subsequent connected blocks.
3. A block remains dormant until it receives all necessary information to commence its operation.
4. This process continues, with some blocks operating concurrently when possible, until the entire flow reaches completion.

This architecture allows for the creation of sophisticated AI workflows, where the output of one AI task becomes the catalyst for the next, facilitating intelligent decision-making and automatic task completion.

## Creating a New Workflow

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Workflow Creation">
    Click the "Create new workflow" button in the top right corner of the Workflows Overview page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Workflow Type">
    In the new window, select from one of three options:
    - "Start from a blank Workflow" to create a new workflow from scratch
    - "Clone an existing Workflow" to create a copy of a workflow you've already made
    - "Clone a Public Template" to begin with one of our pre-built base templates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Workflow Details">
    Provide essential information such as name and description for your workflow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Workflow Editor">
    Click "Next" to proceed to the workflow editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin Building">
    Click "Start building" to commence creating your new workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your newly created workflow will now appear in the "My workflows" list on the Workflows Overview page, ready for you to start constructing your AI-powered process.

## Removing a Flow

<Warning>
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
  Deleting a flow cannot be undone. Please be sure before proceeding.
</Warning>

To remove a flow:
1. Right-click on the flow name in the sidebar list
2. Select "Delete Flow" from the menu that appears
=======
  Deleting a flow is an irreversible action. Please exercise caution and ensure you want to proceed before deletion.
</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="../assets/workflows_delete.gif" alt="Workflow Deletion Process" />
</Frame>

1. Navigate to the card representing the workflow you wish to delete.
2. Click on the workflow to open its details.
3. On the workflow screen, locate and click the settings icon (typically a cog or gear symbol).
4. In the settings menu, find and select the 'Delete Workflow' option.
5. Confirm the deletion, acknowledging that this action will permanently remove the workflow and all associated data.

## Starting a Flow

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
<Card title="Running Your Workflow" icon="play">
  To start the current flow, click the **Run** button in the top right corner. You can watch the flow in action, seeing how information moves through your AI-powered process.
=======

</Frame>

<Card title="Executing Your Workflow" icon="play">
  To run the currently selected flow, click the **Run** button located in the top right corner of the workflow page. You can observe the flow's execution in real-time, monitoring how data traverses through your AI chain.

## Flow Inputs and Outputs

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Flows can receive information (inputs) and produce results (outputs). This makes them versatile and reusable in different situations.
=======
Flows in Lawme are designed as a graph-like structure, where inputs and outputs are determined by specific blocks within the workflow. This approach enhances flexibility and reusability across various scenarios.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Flow Structure

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Use [Input Blocks](../../block-reference/input) to define what information your flow needs to start. Think of these as the questions your flow needs answered before it can begin.
=======
<Card title="Graph-like Design" icon="diagram-project">
  Flows are composed of interconnected blocks, forming a directed graph where data flows from inputs to outputs through various processing steps.
</Card>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Inputs

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Use [Output Blocks](../../block-reference/output) to specify what results your flow should produce when it's finished.

<Tip>
  When designing flows, consider what key information your process needs to start (inputs) and what valuable insights or actions it should produce (outputs).
=======
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Input Blocks" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket">
    [Input Blocks](../../block-reference/input) serve as entry points for data in your flow. They define the parameters your workflow requires to run.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Inputs" icon="layer-group">
    Flows can have multiple input blocks, allowing for complex data ingestion scenarios.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Outputs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Output Blocks" icon="arrow-right-from-bracket">
    [Output Blocks](../../block-reference/output) define the results your flow returns upon completion. They act as exit points for processed data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Outputs" icon="share-nodes">
    Flows can have multiple output blocks, enabling diverse result structures.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Data Flow

Data traverses through the workflow, being transformed and processed by various blocks before reaching the output. The graph-like structure allows for:

- Parallel processing
- Conditional branching
- Data aggregation and splitting

This flexible architecture enables the creation of complex, powerful workflows tailored to specific legal tasks and processes.

<Tip>
  When designing flows, consider the critical information your workflow needs (inputs) and the valuable insights or actions it should generate (outputs).

## Best Practices for Designing Flows

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic process and add more complexity as needed.
2. **Use Clear Names**: Give your flows and blocks descriptive names that explain their purpose.
3. **Add Explanations**: Use comments or notes to explain how your flow works.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the testing features to make sure your flow works correctly with different inputs.

By mastering flows, you'll be able to create powerful, AI-driven processes that automate complex legal tasks and make your work more efficient.
