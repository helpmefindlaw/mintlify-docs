## Saving Your Work

Saving your work in Odella is crucial to ensure that all your changes are preserved. Here's what you need to know about saving:

</Frame>

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Odella automatically saves your work before you run a workflow, ensuring your changes are always protected when executing your flows.

  <Card

    Manually save your work at any time by pressing Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac).

</Callout>

### Save Indicators

Odella provides visual indicators to show the save status of your work:

- A green checkmark indicates that all changes have been saved.
- A spinning icon indicates that changes are being saved.
- A red exclamation mark indicates that there are unsaved changes.

<Tip>
  Always ensure your work is saved before closing the browser or logging out. If you see the red exclamation mark, make sure to manually save your changes.
</Tip>

## Sidebar

The sidebar is your central navigation hub, offering quick access to project information, flows, and flow-specific details.

<Frame>

  <img src="../assets/workflow_sidebar_dark.gif" alt="Sidebar (Dark Mode)" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### General Tab

The General tab allows you to set basic information about your workflow:

- **Workflow Name**: Set a clear, descriptive name for your workflow.
- **Workflow Description**: Provide a concise overview of your workflow's purpose and scope.

<Tip>
  A well-documented project makes collaboration easier and helps you quickly identify the right workflow when you need it.
</Tip>

### Flows Tab

The Flows tab is where you manage your workflow components:

- **Main Flow**: The primary, undeletable flow of your workflow.
- **Flow Explorer**: Click on any flow to view and edit it.
- **Add Flow**: Click the "+" icon to create a new flow.
- **Rename Flow**: Use the pencil icon to edit a flow's name and description.
- **Delete Flow**: Remove a flow with the trash icon. Note: This action is irreversible.

Use this tab to organize and structure your legal workflow efficiently.

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a flow is permanent and cannot be undone. Always ensure you have a backup of your workflow before making significant changes.
</Callout>

### Plugins Tab

The Plugins tab allows you to integrate external services and extend the functionality of your workflows:

Currently available plugins include:

- **G-Mail**: Draft, send and search for e-mails in your workflows using G-Mail.
- **Hubspot**: Search your Hubspot CRM for contacts and companies.
- **Google Drive**: Access files in your Google Drive for use in our template builder and within your workflows.

<Tip>
  Connecting plugins enhances your workflow capabilities by allowing seamless integration with external tools and services you already use.
</Tip>

### Builder Tab

The Builder tab provides settings to customize your workflow environment:

- **Previous data per node to keep**: Set the number of previous data values to retain for each node. This helps in tracking the history of node operations.
- **Zoom sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of zooming when using the mouse wheel. Move the slider towards "Slow" for finer control or "Fast" for quicker zooming.

<Tip>
  Experiment with these settings to find the optimal configuration for your workflow management style. Adjusting the zoom sensitivity can greatly improve your navigation experience on the canvas.
</Tip>

### Delete Workflow

The Delete Workflow tab allows you to permanently remove a workflow and all its associated data:

To delete a workflow:

1. Click the **"Delete workflow"** button in the sidebar to open the deletion interface.
2. To prevent accidental deletions, you must **type the exact name** of the workflow you wish to delete in the text field (e.g., "Delete New test workflow").
3. The delete button will become **active** once the correct name is entered.
4. Click the **"Delete New test workflow"** button to permanently remove the workflow.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Deleting a workflow is irreversible.** Ensure you have backups of any important data before proceeding with deletion.
