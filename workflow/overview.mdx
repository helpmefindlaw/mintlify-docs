# Workflows Overview

<Callout type="info">
  At the heart of Lawme lies its workflowsâ€”the engine that powers your virtual assistants and automates routine legal tasks.
</Callout>

Workflows connect the dots, automating everything from research to document drafting, while your team focuses on delivering high-value legal work. Each assistant in Lawme has access to public workflows for common tasks, as well as custom workflows tailored specifically to your firm.
