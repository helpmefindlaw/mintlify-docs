# Workflows Overview

At the heart of Lawme lies its **workflows**—the engine that powers your virtual assistants and automates routine legal tasks. Workflows connect the dots, automating everything from research to document drafting, while your team focuses on delivering high-value legal work. Each assistant in Lawme has access to public workflows for common tasks, as well as custom workflows tailored specifically to your firm.

## Why Workflows Matter

Workflows are the backbone of your legal operations in Lawme. They handle repetitive tasks, ensure consistency, and allow your assistants to respond quickly and accurately—whether they’re managing client intake, drafting contracts, or researching legal precedents.

- **24/7 Automation**: Your workflows never sleep. They continuously execute tasks, keeping your firm’s operations moving round the clock.
- **Public & Custom Options**: Assistants can tap into public workflows for standard tasks, but you can also design custom workflows tailored to your firm’s specific needs and internal processes.

## Designing Your Workflows

Workflows in Lawme are flexible and customisable, allowing you to shape how legal tasks are performed:

1. **Pre-Built Workflows**  
   Access a library of ready-made workflows for common legal tasks. These public workflows provide immediate value by automating tasks like legal research, compliance checks, and document generation. Your assistants can jump straight into action with minimal setup.

2. **Custom Workflows**  
   Tailor your workflows to suit your firm’s unique needs. With Lawme’s Workflow Builder, you can design workflows from scratch, incorporating your specific templates, documents, and legal requirements. This gives you the freedom to automate tasks in a way that matches how your firm operates.

## Creating, Saving, and Opening Workflows

1. **Creating a New Workflow**  
   To create a new project, choose **New Workflow** in the File menu. This will start a new, blank project. The project remains unsaved until you choose to save it.

2. **Workflow Info**  
   Head to the **Workflow Info** tab in the left sidebar to give your project a name and optional description. This metadata doesn’t affect the execution but helps with organisation.

3. **Saving a Workflow**  
   Save your workflow anytime by pressing **Ctrl+S/Cmd+S** or choosing **Save Workflow** from the File menu. If it's a new project, you’ll be prompted to select a location to save it. You can also use **Ctrl+Shift+S/Cmd+Shift+S** (or **Save Workflow As**) to save the project to a new location.

4. **Opening a Workflow**  
   To open an existing workflow, press **Ctrl+O/Cmd+O** or select **Open Workflow** from the File menu. This will bring up a file dialog to locate and open your project.

## Integrating Workflows with Assistants

Your virtual assistants rely on workflows to handle the tasks they’re assigned. Each assistant is linked to relevant workflows, allowing them to execute jobs seamlessly:

- **Assign Tasks**: Use workflows to automate tasks like drafting documents, performing legal research, or managing client queries.
- **Task Management**: Custom workflows can be built to ensure that tasks are handled according to your specific legal requirements and operational standards.

## Workflow in Action

Lawme’s workflows aren't just static sequences—they interact dynamically with your firm’s operations. Whether it’s routing a task to the right assistant or pulling information from your document store, workflows are constantly at work behind the scenes.

- **Efficient Task Routing**: Automatically assign tasks to the appropriate assistant based on their role, ensuring that the right person handles the right job.
- **Data-Driven**: Workflows can pull from your document store, using metadata extraction and AI-driven insights to enhance accuracy and speed.

## Running, Pausing, and Managing Workflows

From the **Action Bar**, you have full control over your workflows:

- **Run**: Kickstart a workflow with a single click. 
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause an in-progress workflow to make adjustments, then pick up where you left off.
- **Abort**: Need to stop a workflow mid-run? The abort button allows you to quickly halt any active workflow.

Workflows are the invisible force keeping your firm running smoothly, allowing your team to focus on strategy while the day-to-day work gets done automatically.
