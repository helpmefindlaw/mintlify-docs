## Key Concepts

### Block

These TypeScript libraries allow you to execute projects generated by the Lawme Application. They provide a simple API for integrating Lawme with your application. Once you've created a flow in the Lawme App, you can execute it within your application like a function call. This makes it easy to integrate Lawme's AI capabilities into your existing projects.

## Block-Based Editor

Lawme's block-based editor enables you to create, configure, and debug complex AI prompt chains and AI agent chains visually. This approach makes it easier to understand the flow of data and the state of your AI agent at any point in time. The editor allows you to view the input and output of every block, as well as AI responses in real-time, making it simple to identify and fix issues. Check out the [overview of the interface](docs/user-guide/workflow/overview-of-interface) and [adding & connecting blocks](docs/user-guide/workflow/adding-connecting-blocks) for more information.

## Library of Blocks

Lawme features a library of block types to execute common functionality for blocks. Some essential block types include Text, Chat, Match, Loop Controller, Extract YAML, Extract JSON, Chunk, Trim Chat Messages, and External Call. These blocks can be connected together using wires, allowing data to flow between them.

Documentation for all blocks can be found in the [**Block Reference**](docs/block-reference).

### Flow

## Live Debugging

Lawme offers live debugging of AI chains as they run, allowing you to monitor the state of your AI agent in real-time and quickly identify any issues that may arise.

### Remote Debugging

Lawme also supports remote debugging, allowing you to debug AI chains running on a remote server. This is useful for debugging AI agents that are running in a production environment. See the [remote debugging](docs/user-guide/workflow/remote-debugging) section for more information.
