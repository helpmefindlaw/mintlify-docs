# User Benefits

With Lawme’s Document Store, your firm gains the ability to:

- **Increase Efficiency**: Eliminate the need to manually search through documents. The Document Store automates the retrieval of important legal data for faster task completion.
- **Customise for Your Needs**: Whether you need general legal data or firm-specific documents, Lawme offers customisable options to meet your unique workflow requirements.
- **Ensure Accuracy**: Leverage Lawme’s proprietary legal datasets to ensure precise, legally sound information in your workflows.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Teams can easily share and access the necessary documents and data through organised vaults, streamlining cross-team collaboration and case management.

### Setting Up Your Document Store

1. **Create a Vault**  
   Navigate to the Document Store tab in the platform, and click “Create New Vault.” From here, you can upload your firm’s important documents, such as contracts, compliance records, or client reports, into a secure, searchable vault.

2. **Assign to Workflows**  
   Once your vault is set up, link it to relevant workflows to automate tasks like contract drafting, legal research, or regulatory compliance checks. This ensures that every time a task requires specific documents or data, the system retrieves it automatically.

3. **Manage Access and Security**  
   Maintain control over who can access and edit specific vaults by setting user permissions. With role-based access controls, you can ensure that sensitive documents remain secure and are only available to authorised team members.
