## Introduction and Overview

Welcome to Lawme.AI’s Document Store! This feature is designed to simplify and automate your legal workflows by providing access to both public datasets and private, customisable vaults. Leveraging the power of public LLMs (Large Language Models) alongside Lawme’s unique legal datasets, the Document Store enables your firm to streamline its legal research, drafting, and analysis processes in a user-friendly environment.

Whether you need general legal data or tailored, firm-specific resources, Lawme’s Document Store allows you to organise, access, and deploy legal documents with precision and ease.

### Key Features

1. **Access Public Workflows with LLM Integration**  
   The Document Store connects seamlessly to public datasets powered by the latest LLMs, giving your team access to up-to-date legal information and workflow automation without the need to maintain these datasets internally.

2. **Proprietary Legal Data**  
   Lawme enhances the power of general LLMs with its proprietary legal datasets, specifically built to go beyond what public data can offer. This means more accurate, legal-specific workflows that are uniquely tailored to the legal industry’s demands.

3. **Custom Vaults**  
   Create and manage private, secure vaults for your firm’s documents. You can upload and organise contracts, guidelines, policies, and more—allowing your team to quickly retrieve important legal data during workflows.

4. **Workflow Automation**  
   Automate time-consuming tasks like legal research, drafting, and analysis. Using our pre-built workflows or custom workflows, your team can streamline operations, reduce manual work, and focus on delivering high-value insights.
