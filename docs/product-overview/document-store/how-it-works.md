# How It Works

1. **Public Datasets**  
   LawMe provides access to a wealth of public legal data, harnessing the power of LLMs to help your team retrieve information for drafting, research, or compliance quickly and accurately. These public datasets are continually updated to ensure you have the latest legal information at your fingertips.

2. **Custom Document Vaults**  
   If your firm has unique datasets or specific legal documents, you can create custom vaults. These vaults allow you to store sensitive data securely while enabling quick access for document drafting, case research, or client reports. By linking your vaults to specific workflows, you ensure that relevant data is always readily available when needed.

3. **Integrating with Workflows**  
   Your Document Store is more than just a repository—it’s deeply integrated with LawMe’s workflow automation. This integration enables you to link specific datasets or vaults directly to workflows, automating routine tasks such as pulling relevant clauses from past contracts, performing legal research, or generating reports based on previous legal outcomes.

## User Benefits

With LawMe’s Document Store, your firm gains the ability to:

- **Increase Efficiency**: Eliminate the need to manually search through documents. The Document Store automates the retrieval of important legal data for faster task completion.
- **Customise for Your Needs**: Whether you need general legal data or firm-specific documents, LawMe offers customisable options to meet your unique workflow requirements.
- **Ensure Accuracy**: Leverage LawMe’s proprietary legal datasets to ensure precise, legally sound information in your workflows.
- **Enhance Collaboration**: Teams can easily share and access the necessary documents and data through organised vaults, streamlining cross-team collaboration and case management.

### Setting Up Your Document Store

1. **Create a Vault**  
   Navigate to the Document Store tab in the platform, and click “Create New Vault.” From here, you can upload your firm’s important documents, such as contracts, compliance records, or client reports, into a secure, searchable vault.

2. **Assign to Workflows**  
   Once your vault is set up, link it to relevant workflows to automate tasks like contract drafting, legal research, or regulatory compliance checks. This ensures that every time a task requires specific documents or data, the system retrieves it automatically.

3. **Manage Access and Security**  
   Maintain control over who can access and edit specific vaults by setting user permissions. With role-based access controls, you can ensure that sensitive documents remain secure and are only available to authorised team members.
