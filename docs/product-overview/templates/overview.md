### Key Features of Templating:

- **Use Existing Templates**: Effortlessly access and edit your organisationâ€™s existing templates, ensuring that all documents maintain a consistent format while reducing the need for manual revisions.
- **Automated Editing**: Automatically populate templates with client data or other relevant information, simplifying the editing process and reducing the risk of human error.
- **Custom Templates**: Create custom templates or modify existing ones to suit your firm's specific needs, ensuring consistency and compliance with your internal standards.
- **Consistency and Accuracy**: Ensure uniformity across all documents, giving your clients a professional, error-free experience.

By using existing templates and automating the editing process, your team can significantly reduce time spent on repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex legal challenges and client needs.
