## Overview

The Array Block is used to construct an array from one or more inputs of any type. It can also be used to merge multiple arrays into a single array using the `Flatten` setting.

By default, inputs will be flattened, so if any of the inputs are arrays themselves, they will be merged into the output array. This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the `Flatten` setting.

### Example 1: Creating an Array from Multiple Inputs

Let's say you have three Text blocks: one with the value `"Hello"`, another with the value `"World"`, and the last one with the value `"!"`. If you want to create an array from these three strings, you can do the following:

1. Add an Array Block to your flow.
2. Connect the output of the first Text block to `Input 1` of the Array Block.
3. Connect the output of the second Text block to `Input 2` of the Array Block.
4. Connect the output of the third Text block to `Input 3` of the Array Block.

The `Output` of the Array Block will now be `["Hello", "World", "!"]`.

### Example 2: Creating an Array from Array Inputs

Imagine you have two Array blocks: one with the value `["One", "Two"]` and the other with the value `["Three", "Four"]`. If you want to create a new array from these two arrays, you can do the following:

1. Add an Array Block to your flow.
2. Connect the output of the first Array block to `Input 1` of the Array Block.
3. Connect the output of the second Array block to `Input 2` of the Array Block.
4. Enable the `Flatten` setting.

The `Output` of the Array Block will now be `["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]`.

### Example 3: Creating an Array without Flattening

If you want to create an array from arrays without flattening them, you can do the same steps as in Example 2, but leave the `Flatten` setting disabled. The `Output` of the Array Block will then be `[["One", "Two"], ["Three", "Four"]]`.

### Example 4: Using the Indices Output

Let's say you have an Array Block with the value `["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]`. If you want to create a new array where each element is a string that includes the index and the corresponding fruit name from the original array, you can do the following:

1. Add a Text Block to your flow with the text `"[{{index}}] - {{fruit}}"`.
2. Connect the `Output` of the Array Block to the `Fruit` input of the Text Block.
3. Connect the `Indices` output of the Array Block to the `Index` input of the Text Block.
4. Enable the `Split` setting on the Text Block.

The `Output` of the Text Block will now be `["[0] - Apple", "[1] - Banana", "[2] - Cherry"]`.

In this example, the `Indices` output of the Array Block gives us an array of indices that corresponds to the elements of the original array. We then use these indices along with the original array elements to create a new array of formatted strings. The `Split` setting ensures that the Text Block generates a separate output for each element of the input arrays.

## Flattening Arrays

The Array Block has a `Flatten` setting. When enabled, this setting treats each element of an array input as a separate element to be added to the main array. This is particularly useful when you're dealing with array inputs and want to merge all elements of these arrays into a single array.

:::caution

Note that with flatten disabled you can get arrays of arrays. These are not well supported in Lawme and you may have to use a [Code Block](./code) to work with them.

:::

If the `Deep` setting is enabled, the Array Block will recursively flatten all array inputs. This means that if an array input contains another array, the Array Block will flatten the inner array as well. You can
use the Array Block as a Flatten block this way.

## Error Handling

If an input is missing or null, the Array Block will simply ignore it during the array creation process. This can be useful when dealing with optional inputs that may not always be present.

**Q: What happens if I connect a non-array block to the Array Block?**

A: The Array Block is designed to work with any type of inputs. If a non-array input is connected, the block will treat it as a single element to be added to the array.

**Q: Can I connect an Array Block to another Array Block?**

A: Yes, you can connect an Array Block to another Array Block. If the `Flatten` setting is enabled, each element of the input array will be treated as a separate element to be added to the main array. If `Flatten` is disabled, the input array will be added as a single element to the main array.

**Q: What happens if an input is missing or null?**

A: If an input is missing or null, the Array Block will simply ignore it during the array creation process. This can be useful when dealing with optional inputs that may not always be present.
