Provides interpolation capabilities to dynamically insert values into the message, and can compute a token count for the generated chat message. |
| [Split Text](./split-text.mdx)                                     | Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter, which can be set either directly in the block settings or dynamically via an input port. Useful for separating a string into individual elements for further processing.                                          |
| [Text](./text.mdx)                                                 | Outputs a string of text and supports interpolation using `{{tags}}` within the text. Useful for creating dynamic, richly formatted text and supports markdown.                                                                                                                              |

| [If/Else](./if-else.mdx)         | Allows for decision-making in the control flow by choosing between two different values based on a condition. Particularly useful for ensuring that a flow always returns a value, or that a later block always receives a value even if intermediate blocks do not run.                          |
| [Match](./match.mdx)             | Matches a string input against a series of regular expressions, routing control flow based on the content of the string. Executes the output port for each matching regular expression and the `Unmatched` output port if no match is found.                                                     |
| [Passthrough](./passthrough.mdx) | Transfers the input value directly to the output without modification. Useful for grouping values from different branches of your flow or controlling wire flow without altering the value.                                                                                                     |
| [Race Inputs](./race-inputs.mdx) | Manages multiple inputs, outputting the value of the first input to complete while cancelling the remaining inputs. Especially useful when dealing with multiple operations that could satisfy the same requirement, allowing for the use of the result from the operation that concludes first. |

## Input/Output

| Block                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Input](./input.mdx)             | Defines an input for a flow, which can be passed in when the flow is called using the SDK or defines one of the input ports when the flow is used as a subflow. Especially useful for creating reusable subflows that can accept different inputs each time they are used. |
| [Output](./output.mdx)           | Defines the outputs of a flow, with each instance representing an individual output. Turns into an output port when the flow is used as a subflow, and the value passed into becomes part of the overall flow output.                                                       |
| [Read File](./read-file.mdx)                 | Reads the contents of a specified file from the file system and outputs it as a string. Requires a native API to be available in the context when the flow is being run and offers settings to handle errors and dynamic file paths.                                           |
| [User Input](./user-input.mdx)               | Prompts the user for input during the execution of the flow, and the user's response becomes the output of the block. Can use a static prompt defined in the block settings or dynamic prompts provided via the block's input.                                                    |

Can be configured to retrieve the value on demand or to wait until the variable is available, making it adaptable to various execution scenarios.                                                                        |
| [HTTP Call](./http-call.mdx)             | Makes an HTTP call to a specified URL with a given method, headers, and body. Especially useful for interacting with external APIs or services. Supports all HTTP methods and allows custom headers and a request body.                                                                           |
| [Loop Controller](./loop-controller.mdx) | Creates loops within your flow, controlling the flow of values and maintaining the state of the loop. Contains a dynamic number of pairs of inputs and outputs, with the ability to control the continuation of the loop through a `Continue` input port.                                        |
| [Raise Event](./raise-event.mdx)         | Triggers an event within the flow, which can be picked up by the host project or a 'Wait For Event Block' in the same flow. Requires an event name and optional event data, allowing actions to be initiated or different parts of the flow to be synchronized based on the state of the flow. |
| [Set Global](./set-global.mdx)           | Sets a global value that is shared across all flows and subflows during an execution in Lawme. Allows you to specify the ID of the global value and the value itself, which can be of any data type.                                                                                            |
| [Subflow](./subflow.mdx)               | Executes another flow within the current flow, facilitating logic reuse and complex flow breakdown. Automatically updates its inputs and outputs to match the selected subflow and has an optional error output for handling execution errors.                                                |
| [Wait For Event](./wait-for-event.mdx)   | Pauses the execution of a flow until a specific event is signaled by a Raise Event Block or the host project. Beneficial for cases where the flow execution needs to wait for an external event, like a user's click or an API call completion.                                                  |
