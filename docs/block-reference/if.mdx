### Example 1: Simple `string` comparison

- Let's say we're trying to build a simple string comparison. The code for which in Typscript would look something like below:
```
if('Hello, World!' === 'Not Hello, World!')
```
- Similarly in Lawme we can make the following flow to perform a similar comparison. 

![if-block-example-1](./assets/if-block-example.png)

1. Create the following blocks in your flow:
    - An `If` block 
    - A `Compare` block
    - Two `Input Text` blocks: System Text and Input Text
    - Two `Flow Output` blocks: True Output and False Output
2. Connect the following blocks:
    - System Text `Output` to `A` of the Compare block and `Value` of the If block
    - Input Text `Output` to `B` of the Compare block
      - Make sure the Compare condition is set at `==`
    - If Block `True` to True Output
    - If Block `False` to False Output
3. You are ready to run the flow
4. Results: You'll see that based on the Input Text, and the comparison we've supplied to the If block, the flow output execution changes. 
If the If condition supplied to the block is true, the true port receives the value but if its false, the false port receives the values.
