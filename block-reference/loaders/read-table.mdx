## Overview

The Read Table Block is designed to read and parse CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, converting them into structured table data that can be easily manipulated and analyzed within your workflow. This block is particularly useful for processing tabular data stored in CSV format.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="File" type="file">
  The input CSV file to be read and parsed. Required. This should be a file data value, typically provided by a File block or another block that outputs file data.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Table" type="object[]">
  An array of objects representing the parsed CSV data. Each object in the array corresponds to a row in the CSV file, with keys representing column headers and values representing cell contents.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Has Header" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Indicates whether the first row of the CSV file should be treated as column headers. If set to false, default column names (Column1, Column2, etc.) will be used.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Delimiter" type="string" default=",">
  The character used to separate values in the CSV file. Common options include comma (,), semicolon (;), and tab (\t).
</ParamField>

## Example: Reading a CSV File

1. Add a Read Table block to your flow.
2. Connect a File block containing a CSV file to the `File` input of the Read Table block.
3. In the block settings, ensure "Has Header" is set to true if your CSV file includes a header row.
4. Run your flow. The block will output a structured table representation of the CSV data.

## Error Handling

- If the input file is missing or invalid, the block will return an error.
- If there are issues parsing the CSV file (e.g., inconsistent number of columns), the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Ensure that your CSV file is well-formed and consistent. Inconsistencies in the file structure may lead to parsing errors or unexpected results.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can this block read other tabular file formats besides CSV?">
    The Read Table block is primarily designed for CSV files. For other tabular formats like Excel (.xlsx) or TSV, you may need to use specialized blocks or convert the files to CSV format first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the block handle large CSV files?">
    The Read Table block can handle moderately sized CSV files. For very large files, consider using streaming or chunking approaches to process the data in smaller batches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the CSV file contains non-string data types?">
    By default, all values are read as strings. You may need to perform type conversion on the resulting table data if you require specific data types (e.g., numbers, dates) for further processing.
  </Accordion>
