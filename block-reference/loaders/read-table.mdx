## Overview
The Read Table Block is designed to read and parse CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, converting them into structured table data that can be easily manipulated and analyzed within your workflow. This block is particularly useful for processing tabular data stored in CSV format.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="file" type="file" required>
  The input CSV file to be read and parsed. Must have a media type of "text/csv". This should be a file data value, typically provided by a File block or another block that outputs file data.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="output" type="table">
  A table data structure containing the parsed CSV data. Each row in the table corresponds to a row in the CSV file, with columns representing the CSV fields.
</ResponseField>

## Error Handling

- If the input file is missing or invalid, the block will return an error.
- If the file lacks a media type, the block will throw an error.
- If the file's media type is not "text/csv", the block will throw an error.
- If a FileProvider is needed to load from URL but not available, the block will throw an error.
- If there are issues parsing the CSV file, the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Only CSV files with media type "text/csv" are currently supported. Ensure your input files are in CSV format with the correct media type.
</Warning>

## Example: Reading a CSV File

1. Add a Read Table block to your flow.
2. Connect a File block containing a CSV file to the `file` input.
3. Run your flow. The block will parse the CSV and output a table data structure.
