## Overview

The Read File Block is used to read the contents of a file and output it as either plain text or markdown. This block is particularly useful for processing text-based files within your workflow.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="File" type="file">
  The input file to be read. Required. This should be a file data value, typically provided by a File block or another block that outputs file data.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Content" type="string">
  The contents of the file, read as either plain text or markdown, depending on the block settings.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Output Format" type="string" default="Plain Text">
  Determines how the file content is interpreted and output. Options are:
  - "Plain Text": Outputs the file content as raw text.
  - "Markdown": Interprets and outputs the file content as markdown.
</ParamField>

## Example: Reading a Text File

1. Add a Read File block to your flow.
2. Connect a File block containing a text file to the `File` input of the Read File block.
3. In the block settings, select "Plain Text" as the Output Format.
4. Run your flow. The block will output the raw text content of the file.

## Error Handling

- If the input file is missing or invalid, the block will return an error.
- If there are issues reading the file (e.g., file permissions, corrupted file), the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to read the input file. For large files, consider potential memory usage implications.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What types of files can I read with this block?">
    The Read File block is designed to work with text-based files. It's ideal for reading plain text files, markdown files, CSV files, JSON files, and other text formats. Binary files may not be interpreted correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Markdown output differ from Plain Text?">
    When set to Markdown output, the block will interpret markdown syntax in the file. This can be useful if you plan to further process or display the content while preserving formatting and structure defined by markdown.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a size limit for files that can be read?">
    While there's no strict size limit imposed by the block, reading very large files may be limited by available memory and system resources. For extremely large files, consider using streaming or chunking approaches.
