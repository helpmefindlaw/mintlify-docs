## Overview

The Confirm Block is a user input block that prompts the user for confirmation. It returns either true or false based on the user's response, making it useful for controlling flow in your application based on user inputs.

## Example: Confirming a Delete Action

1. Add a Confirm Block to your flow before a critical delete action.
2. Set the `Message` input to "Are you sure you want to delete this item? This action cannot be undone."
3. Connect the `Confirmed` output to a conditional block.
4. If `Confirmed` is true, proceed with the delete action. If false, skip the delete action.

## Error Handling

The Confirm Block does not typically produce errors as it simply waits for user input. However, if there are issues with the user interface or the block fails to receive a response, it may timeout and return an error.

<Warning>
  Always provide clear and concise messages to users to ensure they understand the implications of their confirmation or denial.
