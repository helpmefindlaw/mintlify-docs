## Overview

The Upload File Block is a user input component that prompts users to upload a file. It's designed to wait for the user to select and upload a file before proceeding with the workflow. This block is particularly useful when you need to incorporate user-provided files into your flow for further processing or analysis.

## Key Features

- Accept file uploads from users
- Limit accepted file types (PDF, CSV, MS Word)
- Customizable prompt message
- Flexible input options for prompt text

## How It Works

1. Add an Upload File Block to your flow
2. Configure the accepted file types and prompt message in the Editor Settings
3. When the flow reaches this block, it will pause and wait for the user to upload a file
4. Once a file is uploaded, the block outputs the file data and the flow continues

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Prompt" type="string" optional>
  The prompt message displayed to the user. Only available if the `Use Prompt Input` setting is enabled.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="File" type="file">
  The uploaded file data. This can be used in subsequent blocks for processing or analysis.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Accepted File Types" type="string[]" default={["pdf", "csv", "docx"]}>
  An array of file extensions that the block will accept. Options include "pdf", "csv", and "docx" (MS Word).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Prompt" type="string" default="Please upload a file">
  The message displayed to the user when prompted to upload a file.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Use Prompt Input" type="boolean" default={false}>
  When enabled, allows the prompt message to be provided via an input port.
</ParamField>

## Example: Uploading a CSV for Analysis

1. Add an Upload File Block to your flow.
2. In the Editor Settings, set `Accepted File Types` to ["csv"].
3. Set the `Prompt` to "Please upload a CSV file for analysis".
4. Connect the `File` output to a Table Block to parse the CSV data.
5. Add subsequent blocks to analyze or visualize the data.

## Error Handling

- If a user attempts to upload a file type that is not accepted, the block will display an error message and continue waiting for a valid file.
- If there are issues with file upload (e.g., network errors, file corruption), the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Always validate and sanitize uploaded files before processing them further in your workflow to ensure security and data integrity.
