![Raise Event Block Screenshot](./assets/raise-event-block.png)

## Overview

The Raise Event Block allows you to trigger an event from within your flow. This event can be listened for by the host project or by a [Wait For Event Block](./wait-for-event.mdx) within the same flow. This can be useful for triggering actions in your host application based on the state of your flow, or for synchronizing different parts of your flow.

The block requires an event name and optionally an event data. The event name is used to identify the event when it is raised, and the event data is any additional information that you want to associate with the event.

### Toast

In the Lawme application, there is a special event named `toast` which can show a toast message. The `toast` event accepts a string as its data, which is used as the message of the toast.

## Example 1: Raise an event with data

1. Create a Text Block and set the text to `Hello, world!`.
2. Create a Raise Event Block and leave the Event Name as `toast`.
3. Connect the Text Block to the `Data` input of the Raise Event Block.
4. Run the flow. The `Result` output of the Raise Event Block should be `Hello, world!`, and a toast message should appear in the Lawme application.

## Example 2: Wait for an Chat call to finish before continuing another part of a flow

1. Create a [Chat Block](./chat.mdx) and give it a prompt using a [Text Block](./text.mdx) such as "What is your name?".
2. Create a Raise Event Block, set the Event Name to `chat`, and connect the `Response` output of the Chat Block to the `Data` input of the Raise Event Block.
3. In a separate part of the flow, add a [Wait For Event Block](./wait-for-event.mdx) and set the Event Name to `chat`.
4. Run the flow. Notice that the Wait For Event Block will not continue until the Chat Block has finished.

## Error Handling

The Raise Event Block will error if the `Event Name` is not provided.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I pass data with the event?**

A: Yes, you can pass data with the event by providing a value to the `Data` input. The data can be of any data type.

**Q: What happens if I raise an event that no one is listening for?**

A: If you raise an event that no one is listening for, nothing will happen. The event will be raised and then immediately discarded.

**Q: How is raising event different from an [External Call Block](./external-call.mdx)?**

A: The External Call Block will wait for the external call to complete before continuing, whereas the Raise Event Block will continue immediately after raising the event.
