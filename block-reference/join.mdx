## Overview

The Join Block is used to concatenate an array of strings into a single string. The strings are joined using a specified delimiter.

The Join Block can be used to flatten arrays of strings into a single string. This is useful when you want to format a list of items in a specific way, such as creating a comma-separated list, or joining lines of text with newline characters.

The block also supports the use of special characters as delimiters, such as newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`), and space (` `). To use them, put the literal character in the Join String field in the settings. For example, to use a newline character, you need to press `Enter` in the Join String field.

Arrays that are input into the Join Block will be flattened before being joined. If you connect an array to Input 1 such as `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`, and a single value into Input 2, such as `"orange"`, the output of the Join Block will be `apple, banana, cherry, orange`, if the delimiter is set to `, `.

Array items and inputs will be coerced into strings before joining.

| Join String | `string`  | The string used as a delimiter to join the inputs. This input is only available if `Use Join String Input` is enabled. | N/A           | The input will be coerced into a string if it is not a string. If not provided, the Join String specified in the settings will be used. |

## Example 1: Join an array of strings with a newline

1. Create an [Array Block](./array.mdx) and set the values to `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` with Text Blocks.
2. Create a Join Block and set the Join String to `\n` by deleting the current value and pressing `Enter` in the Join String field in the settings.
3. Connect the Array Block to the `Input 1` port of the Join Block.
4. Run the flow. The output of the Join Block should be:

   ```
   apple
   banana
   cherry
   ```

## Example 2: Join multiple inputs with a space

1. Create three [Text Blocks](./text.mdx) and set their values to `Hello`, `World`, and `!`, respectively.
2. Create a Join Block and set the Join String to ` ` (a space).
3. Connect the Text Blocks to the `Input 1`, `Input 2`, and `Input 3` ports of the Join Block, respectively.
4. Run the flow. The output of the Join Block should be `Hello World !`.

## Error Handling

The Join Block will not error under normal circumstances. If an input is not provided, the Join Block will output an empty string.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use special characters as the Join String?**

A: Yes, you can use special characters such as newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`), and space (` `) as the Join String. To use these characters, you need to enter them literally in the Join String field in the settings. For example, to use a newline character, you need to press `Enter` in the Join String field.

**Q: Can I join an array of numbers or other non-string values?**

A: Yes, you can join an array of any data type. The values will be coerced into strings before being joined.

**Q: Can I use a dynamic Join String?**

A: Yes, you can use a dynamic Join String by enabling the input port toggle for the join string setting. This will create a new `Join String` input port on the block, and you can connect another block to this port to provide the Join String.
