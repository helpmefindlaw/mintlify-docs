description: Trigger events within your flow for host project interaction or flow synchronization
sidebarTitle: Raise Event
---

## Overview

The Raise Event Block allows you to trigger events from within your flow. These events can be listened for by the host project or by a [Wait For Event Block](/block-reference/advanced/wait-for-event) within the same flow. This functionality is useful for:

- Triggering actions in your host application based on the flow's state
- Synchronizing different parts of your flow

The block requires an event name and optionally accepts event data. The event name identifies the event when raised, while the event data can include any additional information you want to associate with the event.

<Note>
  In the Lawme application, there's a special event named `toast` that can display a toast message. The `toast` event accepts a string as its data, which becomes the message content.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Event Name" type="string">
  The name of the event to raise. This input is only available if `Use Event Name Input` is enabled in the settings. Required. Non-string inputs will be coerced into strings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Data" type="any">
  The data to associate with the event. Optional. The input will be coerced into the appropriate data type based on the value.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Result" type="any">
  The data that was associated with the event. If no `Data` input is provided, this will be an empty string (`""`).
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Event Name" type="string">
  The name of the event to raise. Required if `Use Event Name Input` is disabled.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Use Event Name Input" type="boolean" default={false}>
  If enabled, the Event Name can be provided via the Event Name input port.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Example 1: Raise an event with data

1. Create a Text Block with the content "Hello, world!".
2. Add a Raise Event Block and set the Event Name to `toast`.
3. Connect the Text Block to the `Data` input of the Raise Event Block.
4. Run the flow. The `Result` output will be "Hello, world!", and a toast message will appear in the Lawme application.

### Example 2: Synchronize flow parts using events

1. Create a [Chat Block](/block-reference/ai/chat) with a prompt "What is your name?" using a [Text Block](/block-reference/data/text).
2. Add a Raise Event Block, set the Event Name to `chat`, and connect the Chat Block's `Response` output to the Raise Event Block's `Data` input.
3. In another part of the flow, add a [Wait For Event Block](/block-reference/advanced/wait-for-event) with the Event Name set to `chat`.
4. Run the flow. The Wait For Event Block will pause execution until the Chat Block completes.

## Error Handling

The Raise Event Block will error if the `Event Name` is not provided.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I pass data with the event?">
    Yes, you can pass data of any type with the event by providing a value to the `Data` input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I raise an event that no one is listening for?">
    If you raise an event with no listeners, it will be raised and immediately discarded without any effect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is raising an event different from an External Call Block?">
    The [External Call Block](/block-reference/advanced/external-call) waits for the external call to complete before continuing, while the Raise Event Block continues immediately after raising the event.
  </Accordion>
