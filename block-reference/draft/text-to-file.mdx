## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn't do anything fancy like change font sizes or colors, but it does make it easy to create:

- **Bold** or *italic* text
- Lists (like this one!)
- Headers of different sizes
- Links to websites
- And more!

You don't need to know markdown to use this block, but if you do, you can create more structured and styled documents easily.

## Example: Creating a PDF Report

1. Add a Text to File block to your flow.
2. Connect a Text block with your report content to the `Text` input. You can use markdown formatting if desired.
3. In the block settings, select "PDF" as the Output Format.
4. Run your flow. The block will output a PDF file containing your styled report.

## Error Handling

- If the input text is empty, the block will return an error.
- If there's an issue converting the text to the specified file format(s), the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Always review the generated files to ensure the formatting and content appear as expected, especially when using markdown or when creating documents for professional use.
