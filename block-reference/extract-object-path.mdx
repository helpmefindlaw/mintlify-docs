## Overview

The Extract Object Path Block allows you to run [jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) queries on an object. This is useful for extracting data from a JSON object or array. Some use-cases include:

- Extracting data from a JSON object returned by an API
- Accessing individual elements of an array
- Complex queries such as `$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)]` to perform filtering

Any valid [`jsonpath-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) query can be used, but just be careful about complex queries.

The input to Extract Object path must be either an object, or an array of any data type. You can also query properties of non-object data types, such as strings, such as `$.length` to get the length of a string.

| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Match       | `any`     | If the value is found in the object, the value matched.                                                                   | If the value is not found, this port is not ran.                   |
| All Matches | `any[]`   | When using a path that can match multiple times, such as `$.someArray[*]`, represents all paths of the object that match. | If the value is not found, this port will run with an empty array. |

## Example 1: Extract a property from an object

1. Create an [Object Block](./object.mdx) and set the value to the following:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "age": 30
   }
   ```

2. Create an Extract Object Path Block and connect the Object Block to it. Set the `Path` of the Extract Object Path Block to:

   ```
   $.name
   ```

3. Run the flow. The Extract Object Path Block should output the value `John Doe`.

## Example 2: Extract properties from an array of objects

1. Create an [Object Block](./object.mdx) and set the value to the following:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 30
     },
     {
       "name": "Jane Doe",
       "age": 25
     }
   ]
   ```

2. Create an Extract Object Path Block and connect the Object Block to it. Set the `Path` of the Extract Object Path Block to:

   ```
    $[*].name
   ```

3. Run the flow. The Extract Object Path Block's `all_matches` output should have the value `John Doe` and `Jane Doe`. The `match` output contains the first match, which is `John Doe`.

## Example 3: Extract a dynamic property from an object

1. Create an [Object Block](./object.mdx) and set the value to the following:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "age": 30
   }
   ```

2. Create a Text block and set the value to `age`.
3. Create another Text block and set the value to `$.{{input}}`. Connect the first Text block to the second Text block.
4. Create an Extract Object Path block and enable the input port for the `Path` setting. Connect the second Text block to the Extract Object Path block's `Path` input port. Connect the Object Block to the Extract Object Path block.
5. Run the flow. Note that the path is constructed dynamicalled, and the `age` is extracted from the object.

## Error Handling

If the path is invalid, the Extract Object Path Block will throw an error. If the path is valid, but the value is not found, the `match` output will not run, and the `all_matches` output will run with an empty array.

## FAQs

**Q: Does the Extract Object Path Block only work with objects?**

A: No, it can also work with arrays and other JavaScript values that have properties, such as strings. For example, you can use `$.length` to get the length of a string.

**Q: Can I split the Extract Object Path Block in order to execute a command on an array of objects?**

A: It is recommended to simply use the `*` operator and the `All Matches` output, but there can be cases where batching the block is appropriate. For example with an array of objects that themselves contain arrays, and you want to extract all sub-arrays, you can either to `$[*].someArray` or split the block and use `$.someArray` on the split block.

**Q: Can I use the Extract Object Path Block to extract data from a JSON object returned by an API?**

A: Yes, you can use the [HTTP Call Block](./http-call.mdx) to make an API request, and then use the Extract Object Path Block to extract data from the response.
