## Overview

The If/Else Block is a control flow block that allows you to choose between two different values based on a condition. It evaluates a condition and outputs either a "true" value or a "false" value depending on the result.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="If" type="any">
  The condition to evaluate. If truthy, the true value is passed through. Required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="True" type="any">
  The value to pass through if the condition is truthy.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="False" type="any">
  The value to pass through if the condition is not truthy or is not provided.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Output" type="any">
  The value that was passed through based on the condition. Either the true value or false value.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

This block has no configurable editor settings.

## Example: Choose between two values based on a condition

1. Create a Bool Block and set its value to `true`.
2. Create two Text Blocks with values `Hello` and `World`.
3. Create an If/Else Block. Connect the Bool Block to `If`, `Hello` to `True`, and `World` to `False`.
4. Run the flow. The output should be `Hello`.
5. Change the Bool Block to `false` and run again. The output should now be `World`.

  <Accordion title="What happens if the `If` input is `Not Ran`?">
    If the `If` input is `Not Ran`, the `False` value will be passed through instead. If the `False` value is not connected, then the result will again be `Not Ran`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the If/Else Block to choose between two different types of values?">
    Yes, you can use the If/Else Block to choose between two different types of values. For example, you can use it to choose between a string and a number based on a condition. However, keep in mind that the output of the If/Else Block will be of the same type as the value that was passed through.
