## Overview
The If/Else Block is a control flow block that allows you to choose between two different values based on a condition. It evaluates a condition and outputs either a "true" value or a "false" value depending on the result.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="If" type="any">
  If this is truthy, the `true` value will be passed through the output port. Otherwise, the `false` value will be passed through the output port. An unconnected port is considered false. A `Not Ran` value is considered false. Required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="True" type="any">
  The value to pass through the output port if the condition is truthy.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="False" type="any">
  The value to pass through the output port if the condition is not truthy.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Output" type="any">
  The `true` or `false` value, depending on the `if` condition.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Don't run unconnected ports" type="boolean" default={true}>
  If enabled, unconnected input ports are control-flow-excluded. If disabled (legacy behavior), unconnected ports will pass through undefined values.
</ParamField>

## Example: Choose between two values based on a condition

1. Create a Bool Block and set its value to `true`.
2. Create two Text Blocks with values `Hello` and `World`.
3. Create an If/Else Block. Connect the Bool Block to `If`, `Hello` to `True`, and `World` to `False`.
4. Run the flow. The output should be `Hello`.
5. Change the Bool Block to `false` and run again. The output should now be `World`.

## Error Handling

The If/Else block will not throw an error under normal circumstances. If both the true and false values are unconnected or control-flow-excluded, the output will be control-flow-excluded.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is considered truthy in Lawme?">
    The following values are considered truthy:
    - Boolean `true`
    - Any non-zero number
    - Any non-empty string
    - Any non-empty Array
    - Any object with a truthy value
    - Any function

    The following are considered falsy:
    - Boolean `false` 
    - Zero
    - Empty string
    - Empty array
    - null/undefined
    - The string value `"false"`
    - `Not Ran` values
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the `If` input is `Not Ran`?">
    If the `If` input is `Not Ran`, the `False` value will be passed through instead. If the `False` value is not connected and "Don't run unconnected ports" is enabled, then the result will be control-flow-excluded.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the If/Else Block to choose between two different types of values?">
    Yes, you can use the If/Else Block to choose between two different types of values. For example, you can use it to choose between a string and a number based on a condition. The output type will match whichever value (true or false) is passed through.
