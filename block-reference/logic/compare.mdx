## Overview

The Compare Block allows you to perform comparison operations between two input values. It supports various comparison functions including equality, inequality, less than, greater than, and logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="A" type="any">
  The first value for comparison. Required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="B" type="any">
  The second value for comparison. Required.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Output" type="boolean">
  The result of the comparison operation.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Comparison Function" type="string" default="==">
  The comparison function to be used for the operation. Available options are '==', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '!=', 'and', 'or', 'xor'.
</ParamField>

## Example: Compare two numbers

1. Create a Compare Block and set the `Comparison Function` to `>`.
2. Create two Number Blocks, one with the value `5` and the other with the value `3`.
3. Connect the Number Blocks to the `A` and `B` inputs of the Compare Block respectively.
4. Run the flow. The output of the Compare Block will be `true`, because 5 is greater than 3.

## Error Handling

The Compare Block does not have specific error handling. If the inputs are not of the same type, the block will attempt to coerce the second input (`B`) to the type of the first input (`A`).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the inputs are not of the same type?">
    If the inputs are not of the same type, the block will attempt to coerce the second input (`B`) to the type of the first input (`A`). If the coercion is not possible, the comparison will be performed with the original values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the Compare Block to compare arrays or objects?">
    Yes, you can use the Compare Block to compare arrays or objects. However, the comparison will be performed using JavaScript's strict equality (`===`), which may not give the expected results for arrays or objects. For a deep comparison of arrays or objects, consider using a Code Block.
