## Overview

The Abort Flow Block is used to stop the execution of the entire flow immediately. It can either "successfully" abort the flow (early-exit), or "error" abort the flow. This block is useful for stopping the flow under certain conditions or for handling errors.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Data or Error" type="any">
  The data or error message to be used when aborting the flow. If it's a string, it will be used as the error message for error aborting.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Successfully" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Determines whether the flow should be aborted successfully or with an error. Only available if the "Successfully Abort" setting is toggled on in the block's settings.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

This block does not have any outputs.

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Successfully Abort" type="boolean" default={true}>
  Determines whether the flow should be aborted successfully or with an error.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Error Message" type="string">
  The error message to be used when aborting the flow with an error. Only used if "Successfully Abort" is not checked.
</ParamField>

## Example: Successfully aborting a flow

1. Add an Abort Flow block to your flow.
2. Make sure the "Successfully Abort" setting is checked.
3. Connect any block to the `Data or Error` input of the Abort Flow block.
4. Run your flow. The flow will abort immediately after the Abort Flow block is processed.

## Example: Aborting a flow with an error

1. Add an Abort Flow block to your flow.
2. Uncheck the "Successfully Abort" setting.
3. Optionally, enter an error message in the "Error Message" setting.
4. Connect any block to the `Data or Error` input of the Abort Flow block.
5. Run your flow. The flow will abort with an error message.

## Error Handling

The Abort Flow Block does not produce any errors itself. However, it causes the entire flow to stop executing when it is processed, either successfully or with an error.

<Warning>
  Be cautious when using this block, as it will immediately stop the execution of your entire flow.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I connect a non-string block to the `Data or Error` input?">
    If the block outputs a string, it will be used as the error message when the flow is aborted. If it does not output a string, it will be coerced into a string.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I connect a block to the `Successfully` input but the 'Successfully Abort' setting is not checked?">
    The `Successfully` input will be ignored, and the flow will be aborted with an error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't connect anything to the `Data or Error` input or leave the 'Error Message' setting empty?">
    The flow will be aborted with a default error message of "Flow aborted with error".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
