## Overview

The Switch Block is a control flow block that routes the input value to different outputs based on a boolean condition. It evaluates the condition and directs the value to either the TRUE or FALSE output port accordingly.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Condition" type="boolean">
  The condition to evaluate. If truthy, the value is passed to the TRUE output. If falsy, the value is passed to the FALSE output. Required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Value" type="any">
  The value to be routed based on the condition. This value is passed unchanged to either the TRUE or FALSE output. Required.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="TRUE" type="any">
  The output port that receives the input value if the condition is truthy.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="FALSE" type="any">
  The output port that receives the input value if the condition is falsy.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

This block has no configurable editor settings.

## Example: Route a message based on a condition

1. Create a Bool Block and set its value to `true`.
2. Create a Text Block with the value "Hello, World!".
3. Create a Switch Block. Connect the Bool Block to `Condition` and the Text Block to `Value`.
4. Add two Text Blocks to display the output, one connected to TRUE and one to FALSE.
5. Run the flow. The "Hello, World!" message should appear in the Text Block connected to TRUE.
6. Change the Bool Block to `false` and run again. The message should now appear in the Text Block connected to FALSE.

## Error Handling

The Switch block will not throw an error under normal circumstances. If the condition input is missing or cannot be coerced to a boolean, it will be treated as falsy.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the Value input is not provided?">
    If the Value input is not provided, the Switch block will pass `undefined` to the selected output port.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use complex conditions with the Switch block?">
    The Switch block expects a boolean condition. For complex conditions, you may need to use other logic blocks (like If/Else or Match) to evaluate the condition before feeding it into the Switch block.
