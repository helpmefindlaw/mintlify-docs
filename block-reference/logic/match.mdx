The Match Block is used to route control flow based on matching a string input against a series of regular expressions. Each regular expression corresponds to an output of the block. This block is particularly useful for directing workflow based on the content of a string, such as checking for specific keywords in a user's message.

## Key Features

- Match string input against multiple regular expressions
- Option to run either the first matching output or all matching outputs
- Fallback 'Unmatched' output for when no match is found
- Flexible value passing through matched outputs

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Test" type="string" required>
  The value that will be tested against each of the cases. Non-string inputs will be coerced to strings.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Value" type="any">
  The value passed through to the output port that matches. If unconnected, the test value will be passed through.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Case [i]" type="any">
  The value (or test if value is unconnected) passed through if the test value matches the corresponding regex case. The number of these outputs is dynamic based on the number of configured cases. Each output is labeled with its corresponding regex pattern, or "Case N" if the pattern is empty.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Unmatched" type="any">
  The value (or test if value is unconnected) passed through if no regexes match. Will not run if any match is found.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Exclusive" type="boolean" default={false}>
  If enabled, only the first matching branch will be ran. If disabled, all matching cases will run.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Cases" type="string[]" default={["YES", "NO"]}>
  The list of regular expressions to match against. Each case corresponds to an output port.
</ParamField>

## Example: Route control flow based on AI input

1. Create a Chat Block with a prompt asking about preference for cats or dogs.
2. Connect the Chat Block's `Message` output to a Match Block's `Test` input.
3. Set up the Match Block with regex cases for "cats" and "dogs".
4. Create three pairs of If Blocks and Text Blocks for different outcomes.
5. Connect the Match Block's outputs to the corresponding If Blocks.
6. Run the flow to see the routing based on the AI's response.


## Error Handling

The Match Block will error if the `Test` input is not provided. If no match is found, the `Unmatched` output will be executed.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple cases match at once?">
    Yes, multiple cases can match simultaneously. All corresponding output ports will be executed unless the 'Exclusive' setting is enabled.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the Match Block with numbers or lists?">
    Yes, but inputs will be coerced into strings for matching. For lists, each string is typically placed on its own line for testing.
  </Accordion>
