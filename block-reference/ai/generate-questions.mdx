## Inputs

<ParamField path="Prompt" type="string">
  A natural language prompt guiding the question generation process. Required. This prompt helps direct the AI in creating relevant and focused questions.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Value" type="string">
  The input value or context for which questions should be generated. Required. This could be a topic, a piece of text, or any other relevant information.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Number of Questions" type="number">
  The desired number of questions to generate. Required. This determines how many questions the block will output.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Questions" type="string[]">
  An array of generated questions. Each element in the array is a string representing a single question.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Provider" type="string" default="OpenAI">
  The AI provider to use for generating questions. Choose from over 250 available AI models.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Model" type="string" default="GPT-3.5-turbo">
  The specific model to use for the request. Available models depend on the selected provider.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Temperature" type="number" default={0.7}>
  The sampling temperature to use. Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher values allow for more creativity in question generation.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Additional AI model parameters may be available depending on the selected provider and model.

## Example: Generating Research Questions

1. Add a Generate Questions block to your flow.
2. Connect a Text block with a prompt like "Generate research questions about climate change" to the `Prompt` input.
3. Connect another Text block with a value like "Impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities" to the `Value` input.
4. Set the `Number of Questions` to 5 (or your desired number).
5. Configure the AI provider and model in the block settings.
6. Run your flow. The block will output an array of 5 research questions related to the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities.

## Error Handling

- If the input prompt or value is empty, the block will return an error.
- If the number of questions is not a positive integer, the block will return an error.
- If the AI provider fails to generate questions, the block will error after a certain number of retries.

<Warning>
  Always review the generated questions for relevance and appropriateness, especially when using them for critical research or decision-making processes.
