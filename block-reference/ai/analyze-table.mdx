## Overview

The Analyze Table Block uses AI capabilities to perform complex analysis and transformations on tabular data. By providing a natural language prompt, you can instruct the AI to aggregate data, calculate summary statistics, or perform other sophisticated operations on your input table.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Table" type="object[]">
  The input table to be analyzed. Required. Should be an array of objects, where each object represents a row in the table.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Prompt" type="string">
  A natural language prompt describing the analysis or transformation to be performed on the table. Required. This prompt guides the AI in generating the appropriate code for table analysis.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Result Table" type="object[]">
  The resulting table after analysis or transformation. The structure of this table will depend on the operations specified in the prompt.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Provider" type="string" default="OpenAI">
  The AI provider to use for analyzing the table.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Model" type="string" default="GPT-3.5-turbo">
  The specific model to use for the request. Available models depend on the selected provider.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Temperature" type="number" default={0.7}>
  The sampling temperature to use. Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher values allow for more creativity.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Available settings may vary depending on the selected provider and model.
</Note>

## Example: Calculating Summary Statistics

1. Add an Analyze Table block to your flow.
2. Connect your input table to the `Table` input of the Analyze Table block.
3. Add a Text block with a prompt like "Calculate the average age, total salary, and count of employees for each department" and connect it to the `Prompt` input.
4. Select your desired provider and model in the Analyze Table block settings.
5. Run your flow. The block will output a new table with the requested summary statistics.

## Error Handling

- If the input table is empty or invalid, the block will return an error.
- If the AI provider fails to generate appropriate code for table analysis, the block will error after a certain number of retries.
- If the generated code encounters runtime errors during execution, the block will fail and provide error details.

<Warning>
  Always validate the output of the Analyze Table block, especially when working with critical data or making important decisions based on the results.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What types of analysis can the Analyze Table block perform?">
    The block can perform a wide range of operations, including but not limited to: aggregations, filtering, sorting, pivoting, calculating summary statistics, and applying complex transformations. The capabilities are largely determined by the AI model's understanding of the prompt and its ability to generate appropriate code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the Analyze Table block handle large datasets?">
    While the block can process large datasets, performance may vary depending on the size of the input table and the complexity of the requested analysis. For very large datasets, consider using batching or chunking strategies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the block ensure data privacy and security?">
    The Analyze Table block processes data locally within your workflow. However, the prompt and a sample of your data may be sent to the AI provider for code generation. Always ensure you're complying with data privacy regulations and your organization's policies when using this block.
