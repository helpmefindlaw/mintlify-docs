## Overview

The Shuffle Block randomizes the order of elements in an array. It takes an array as input and outputs a new array with the elements in a shuffled order. This block uses the [Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) shuffle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) to ensure a fair distribution of permutations.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Array" type="any[]">
  The array to shuffle. Required.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Shuffled" type="any[]">
  The input array with its order randomized.
</ResponseField>

## Example: Shuffle an array of numbers

1. Create an Array Block with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Add a Shuffle Block and connect the Array Block to its `Array` input.
3. Run the flow. The Shuffle Block's `Shuffled` output should contain the numbers 1 through 5 in a random order.

## Error Handling

- The block will error if the `Array` input is not provided or is not an array.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I shuffle an array of objects?">
    Yes, the Shuffle Block can shuffle arrays of any data type, including objects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the Shuffle Block modify the original array?">
    No, the Shuffle Block does not modify the original array. It creates a new array with the elements in a shuffled order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the shuffle algorithm truly random?">
    The Shuffle Block uses the Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) shuffle algorithm, which is considered a fair shuffle algorithm. However, it relies on the JavaScript `Math.random()` function, which is not suitable for cryptographic purposes.
