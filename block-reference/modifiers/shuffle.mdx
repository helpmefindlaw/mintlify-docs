## Overview
The Shuffle Block randomizes the order of elements in an array. It's like shuffling a deck of cards - you give it a list of items, and it mixes them up into a random order. This is useful when you want to randomize a playlist, create random selections, or add variety to any ordered list.

## Key Features

- Randomly reorders any list of items
- Creates a new shuffled list (keeps your original list unchanged)
- Works with any type of items (numbers, text, objects, etc.)
- Automatically handles single items by treating them as a one-item list

## Inputs

<ParamField path="array" type="any[]" required>
  The list of items you want to shuffle. If you input a single item instead of a list, it will be treated as a one-item list.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="shuffled" type="any[]">
  A new list containing all your input items in a random order.
</ResponseField>

## Example: Shuffle a List of Numbers

1. Create an Array Block with numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. Add a Shuffle Block and connect the Array Block to its `array` input
3. Run the flow. The Shuffle Block's `shuffled` output will contain the same numbers in a random order, like `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`

## Error Handling

- If nothing is connected to the input, the block will output an empty list
- If you input a single item instead of a list, it will work fine - it just treats it as a one-item list

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I shuffle a list of anything, not just numbers?">
    Yes! You can shuffle lists of any type of items - text, numbers, objects, or even mixed content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does shuffling change my original list?">
    No, your original list stays exactly the same. The Shuffle Block creates a new list with the items in a random order.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How random is the shuffle?">
    The shuffle is random enough for most everyday purposes (like shuffling songs or cards), but shouldn't be used for security or gambling purposes where you need true randomness.
