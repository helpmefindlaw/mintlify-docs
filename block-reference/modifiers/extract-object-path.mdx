The Extract Object Path Block allows you to run [JSONPath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) queries on objects or arrays. This block is particularly useful for extracting specific data from complex JSON structures, such as API responses or nested objects.

## Key Features

- Extract data using JSONPath queries
- Support for objects, arrays, and other JavaScript values with properties
- Ability to perform complex queries and filtering
- Dynamic path construction using input ports

## Inputs

<ParamField path="object" type="object | any[] | string" required>
  The object, array, or string to query using the JSONPath.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="path" type="string" required>
  The JSONPath query to use for extracting properties from the input object. Only available when "Use Path Input" is enabled in settings.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="match" type="any">
  The first value that matches the specified path. If no match is found, this output will be control-flow-excluded.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="all_matches" type="any[]">
  An array of all values that match the specified path. If no matches are found, this output will run with an empty array.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="path" type="string" default="$">
  The JSONPath query to use for extracting properties from the input object. Uses JSONPath syntax.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="usePathInput" type="boolean" default={false}>
  When enabled, allows the path to be provided via an input port instead of being set in the settings.
</ParamField>

## Example: Extract a property from an object

1. Create an Object Block with the following JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "age": 30
   }
   ```
2. Add an Extract Object Path Block and connect the Object Block to it.
3. Set the `Path` of the Extract Object Path Block to `$.name`.
4. Run the flow. The Extract Object Path Block should output `John Doe`.

## Error Handling

- If the path is invalid or not provided, the block will throw an error
- If the path is valid but no value is found, the `match` output will be control-flow-excluded and the `all_matches` output will run with an empty array
- If the input object is undefined or null, it will be treated as null for the JSONPath query

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use this block with non-object data types?">
    Yes, the Extract Object Path Block can work with arrays and other JavaScript values that have properties, such as strings. For example, you can use `$.length` to get the length of a string.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I extract data from an API response?">
    You can use the HTTP Call Block to make an API request, and then use the Extract Object Path Block to extract specific data from the response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
