## Overview

The Extract Markdown Code Blocks block is designed to parse markdown-formatted text and extract all code blocks within it. This is particularly useful when working with documentation, README files, or any text that contains code snippets in markdown format.

## Example: Extracting Code from a README

1. Create a new flow and add an Extract Markdown Code Blocks block.
2. Add a Text block with markdown content containing code blocks and connect it to the `Input` of the Extract Markdown Code Blocks block.
3. Add a JSON View block to visualize the extracted code blocks.
4. Run the flow to see the array of extracted code blocks.

## Error Handling

- If no code blocks are found in the input markdown, the block will output an empty array.
- The block will not throw an error for invalid markdown; it will attempt to extract any code blocks it can identify.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What format are the code blocks expected to be in?">
    The block expects code blocks to be formatted using triple backticks (```) as per standard markdown syntax. Both fenced code blocks and indented code blocks are supported.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does this block handle inline code?">
    No, this block is designed to extract full code blocks, not inline code snippets that are typically wrapped in single backticks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
