## Overview

The Slice Block extracts a portion of an array. It takes an array as input and outputs a new array that starts at a specified index and contains a specified number of elements. This block is useful for manipulating arrays, such as extracting a subset of data from a larger dataset.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Input" type="any[]">
  The array to be sliced. Required. Non-array inputs will be coerced into an array.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Start" type="number" default={0}>
  The index at which to start the slice. Optional. Will be coerced into a number if not provided as one.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Count" type="number">
  The number of elements to include in the slice. Optional. If not provided, all elements from the start index will be included. Will be coerced into a number if not provided as one.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Output" type="any[]">
  The sliced array containing the extracted elements from the input array.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Start" type="number" default={0}>
  The index at which to start the slice. If not provided, the slice will start at the beginning.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Count" type="number">
  The number of elements to include in the slice. If not provided, all elements will be included.
</ParamField>

## Example: Slice an array

1. Create an Array Block with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Add a Slice Block and set the `Start` to `2` and the `Count` to `2`.
3. Connect the Array Block to the Slice Block's `Input`.
4. Run the flow. The Slice Block's `Output` should be `[3, 4]`.

## Error Handling

- The block will error if the `Input` is not provided or is not an array.
- It will also error if the `Start` or `Count` is not a number.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the Start is greater than the length of the array?">
    The Slice Block will return an empty array.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the Count is greater than the number of elements in the array?">
    The Slice Block will return all elements from the Start to the end of the array.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use negative numbers for the Start and Count?">
    You can use negative numbers for the Start to count from the end of the array. However, using a negative number for the Count will result in an error.
