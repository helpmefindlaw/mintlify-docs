## Overview

The Flatten Block is designed to simplify complex nested array structures by flattening them into a single-level array. This block is particularly useful when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or when you need to process all elements of a nested structure in a linear fashion.

## Key Features

- Flattens nested arrays of any depth into a single-level array
- Preserves the order of elements from the original nested structure
- Handles arrays containing both nested arrays and non-array elements

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Input" type="any[]">
  The nested array structure to be flattened. Required. Non-array inputs will be returned as-is.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="Flattened" type="any[]">
  The resulting flattened array containing all elements from the input, with nested structures removed.
</ResponseField>

## Example: Flattening a Nested Array

1. Create an Array Block with a nested array structure, e.g., `[1, [2, [3, 4]], 5, [6, 7]]`.
2. Add a Flatten Block and connect the Array Block to its `Input`.
3. Run the flow. The Flatten Block's `Flattened` output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

## Error Handling

- If the input is not an array, the block will return the input as-is without throwing an error.
- The block will not modify non-array elements within the structure.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does the Flatten Block work with objects?">
    The Flatten Block is designed to work with arrays. It will not flatten object structures. If you need to flatten objects, consider using a combination of other blocks or a custom function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to the depth of nesting it can handle?">
    The Flatten Block can handle arbitrarily deep nested array structures. However, extremely deep nesting may impact performance.
