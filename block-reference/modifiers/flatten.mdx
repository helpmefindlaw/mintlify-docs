The Flatten Block is designed to simplify complex nested array structures by flattening them into a single-level array. This block is particularly useful when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or when you need to process all elements of a nested structure in a linear fashion.

## Key Features

- Flattens nested arrays one level deep
- Preserves the order of elements from the original nested structure
- Handles arrays containing both nested arrays and non-array elements

## Inputs

<ParamField path="input" type="any[][]" required>
  The nested array structure to be flattened. Must be a nested array (array of arrays). Non-nested arrays or other types will result in an error.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="output" type="any[]">
  The resulting flattened array containing all elements from the input, with one level of nesting removed.
</ResponseField>

## Example: Flattening a Nested Array

1. Create an Array Block with a nested array structure, e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.
2. Add a Flatten Block and connect the Array Block to its `input`.
3. Run the flow. The Flatten Block's `output` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

## Error Handling

- If no input is provided, the block will error with "Input is required"
- If the input is not a nested array (array of arrays), the block will error with "Input is not a nested array"
- The block will only flatten one level deep - for deeper nesting, multiple Flatten blocks can be chained

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does the Flatten Block work with objects?">
    No, the Flatten Block is designed to work only with nested arrays. It will error if given objects or other non-array inputs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How deep does the flattening go?">
    The Flatten Block only flattens one level deep. For example, `[[1, [2, 3]], [4, 5]]` becomes `[1, [2, 3], 4, 5]`. To flatten deeper levels, chain multiple Flatten blocks together.
