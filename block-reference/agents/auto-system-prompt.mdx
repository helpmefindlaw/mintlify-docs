## Overview

The Auto System Prompt Block is designed to automatically generate system prompts that enhance the guidance for AI models in other blocks, such as the Ask AI Block. By taking a user-provided prompt as input, this block creates a tailored system prompt that helps define the goal and context for the AI model, resulting in more focused and relevant outputs.

## Inputs

<ParamField path="Prompt" type="string">
  The user-provided prompt that describes the desired outcome or task for the AI model. Required.
</ParamField>

## Outputs

<ResponseField name="System Prompt" type="string">
  The automatically generated system prompt that can be used to guide AI models in other blocks.
</ResponseField>

## Editor Settings

<ParamField path="Provider" type="string" default="OpenAI">
  The AI provider to use for generating the system prompt.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Model" type="string" default="GPT-3.5-turbo">
  The specific model to use for the request. Available models depend on the selected provider.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Temperature" type="number" default={0.7}>
  The sampling temperature to use. Lower values produce more focused and deterministic outputs, while higher values allow for more creativity.
</ParamField>

<Note>
  Available settings may vary depending on the selected provider and model.
</Note>

## Example: Enhancing an Ask AI Block

1. Add an Auto System Prompt block to your flow.
2. Connect a Text block with a prompt like "Summarize scientific articles" to the `Prompt` input of the Auto System Prompt block.
3. Add an Ask AI block to your flow.
4. Connect the `System Prompt` output from the Auto System Prompt block to the `System` input of the Ask AI block.
5. Connect your input text to the `Prompt` input of the Ask AI block.
6. Run your flow. The Auto System Prompt block will generate a tailored system prompt, which will then guide the Ask AI block in summarizing scientific articles more effectively.

## Error Handling

- If the input prompt is empty or invalid, the block may generate a generic system prompt or return an error.
- If the AI provider fails to generate a system prompt, the block will error after a certain number of retries.

<Warning>
  While the Auto System Prompt block can significantly improve AI model guidance, it's important to review and potentially refine the generated system prompts for critical applications.
