![Match Block Screenshot](./assets/match-block.png)

## Overview

The Match Block is used to match a string input against a series of regular expressions. Each regular expression corresponds to an output of the block.

The block can be configured to either run the _first_ matching output port, or to run _all_ matching output ports. If no match is found, the `Unmatched` output port will be executed.

This block is useful for routing control flow based on the content of a string. For example, you can use the Match Block to check if a user's message contains certain keywords and route the conversation accordingly.

If the `Value` input is provided, it will be passed through the corresponding output port if a match is found. If the `Value` input is not provided, the `Test` input will be passed through the corresponding output port if a match is found.

## Inputs

| Title | Data Type | Description                                                    | Default Value | Notes                                                          |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test  | `string`  | The string to be tested against the regular expressions.       | (required)    | The input will be coerced into a string if it is not a string. |
| Value | `any`     | The value to be passed to the output port if a match is found. | (optional)    | If not provided, the `Test` input will be used as the value.   |

| Case [i]  | `any`     | The output port corresponding to the ith regular expression.                | Dynamic number of outputs based on the number of regular expressions configured in the block. |
| Unmatched | `any`     | The output port that is executed if no match is found for the input string. | If a match is found for the input string, this output port will not be executed.             |

## Example 1: Route control flow based on AI input

1. Create a [Chat Block](./chat.mdx) and set the `Prompt` to a question, such as:
   > Would you like to hear about information about cats or dogs first? Please only pick one! I will give you information on both, I just want to know what you'd like to hear first.
2. Create a Match Block and connect the `Message` output of the Chat Block to the `Test` input of the Match Block.
3. In the body of the Match Block, set the regular expressions to `cats` and `dogs`.
4. Add three pairs of [If Blocks](./if.mdx) and [Text Blocks](./text.mdx). Connect the `Case 1` output of the Match Block to the first If Block's `If` input, the `Case 2` output of the Match Block to the second If Block's `If` input, and the `Unmatched` output of the Match Block to the third If Block's `If` input. Connect the text blocks to the If Blocks' `Value` inputs.
5. The text of the three Text Blocks should be "You chose cats!", "You chose dogs!", and "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Please try again.", respectively.
6. Run the flow. Depending on the AI's response, the corresponding If Block will be executed, with the text the AI selected

## Error Handling

The Match Block will error if the `Test` input is not provided. If no match is found for the input string, the `Unmatched` output port will be executed.

## FAQ

**Q: Can multiple cases match at once?**

A: Yes, multiple cases can match at once. If multiple cases match, all of the corresponding output ports will be executed. This may become a toggleable option in the future, so that only the first matching case will be executed.

**Q: Can I use the Match Block to match against numbers?**

A: Yes, you can use the Match Block to match against numbers. However, the `Test` input will be coerced into a string for the matching.

**Q: Can I use the Match Block to match against a list of strings?**

A: Yes, you can use the Match Block to match against a list of strings. However, the `Test` input will be coerced into a string for the matching. The default coercion will put each string on its own line for testing against.
