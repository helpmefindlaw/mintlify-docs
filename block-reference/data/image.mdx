## Overview

The Image Block is used to define a static image for use with other blocks or convert binary data into an image type. It supports PNG, JPEG, and GIF formats and requires both image data and a media type specification.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Media Type" type="string">
  The media type of the image (PNG, JPEG, or GIF). This input is only available if the "Use Media Type Input" setting is enabled. Must be one of: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, or `image/gif`.

  If enabled, the block will use the data from the "Data" input port as the image data.

## Example: Creating a Static Image

1. Add an Image Block to your flow.
2. In the block's settings, click "Pick Image" and select an image file from your local file system.
3. Run the flow. The `Image` output of the Image Block will contain the selected image.

  <img src="/images/image-block-example.png" alt="Image Block Example" />
</Frame>

## Error Handling

The Image Block will throw an error if:

- The "Use Data Input" setting is enabled but no data is provided to the "Data" input port.
- The "Use Media Type Input" setting is enabled but no valid media type is provided to the "Media Type" input port.
- The provided image data cannot be converted to the specified media type.

<Warning>
  Ensure that the image data and media type are compatible to avoid errors.
