1. Add a File Block to your flow.
2. In the block's settings, click "Upload File" and select a PDF document from your local file system.
3. Connect the `data` output of the File Block to an AI block capable of analyzing PDF content, such as a custom PDF Analysis block.
4. Run your flow. The PDF content will be processed by the AI block for further analysis or extraction.
