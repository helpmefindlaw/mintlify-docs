2. In the block's settings, click "Upload File" and select a PDF document from your local file system.
3. Connect the `File` output of the File Block to an AI block capable of analyzing PDF content, such as a custom PDF Analysis block.
4. Run your flow. The PDF content will be processed by the AI block for further analysis or extraction.

## Error Handling

The File Block will throw an error if:

- An unsupported file type is uploaded.
- The file upload fails due to network issues or file corruption.
- The file size exceeds the maximum allowed limit.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the maximum file size that can be uploaded?">
    The maximum file size depends on your system configuration. Generally, it's recommended to keep file sizes under 100MB for optimal performance. For larger files, consider splitting them or using alternative data ingestion methods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the File Block to upload multiple files at once?">
    No, the File Block is designed to handle one file at a time. If you need to work with multiple files, you can use multiple File Blocks in your workflow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I process the uploaded file data?">
    The file data output from the File Block can be connected to other blocks in your workflow that are capable of processing the specific file type. For example, you might connect a PDF file to a PDF text extraction block, or a CSV file to a data analysis block.
