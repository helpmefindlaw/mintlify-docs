## Overview

The Comment Block is a special type of block that doesn't perform any operations but serves as a way to add notes or comments to a flow. It can be used to provide additional context or explanation for a group of blocks, making the flow easier to understand. The Comment Block is always rendered behind other blocks and has a distinct appearance with customizable colors.

A comment block is always rendered behind all other blocks in the flow.

## Example Usage

The Comment Block can be used to add notes or comments to a flow. For example, if you have a group of blocks performing a specific operation, you can add a Comment Block behind them to provide a brief explanation of what they do.

Additionally, you can use different colors for the text and background of different Comment Blocks to visually distinguish between different sections of your flow.
