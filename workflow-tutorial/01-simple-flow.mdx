# Simple Flow

<Steps>
  1. Open the flows tab in the sidebar
  2. Find the `1. Simple Flow` folder
  3. Click on the `Simple Flow` flow to open it
</Steps>

You should see a flow that looks like this:

<Frame>
  <img src="./assets/simple-flow-start.png" alt="Simple Flow" />
</Frame>

This flow consists of two blocks:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Text Block" icon="paragraph">
    Allows you to input text
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat Block" icon="comments">
    Processes the text using AI
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Running the Flow

<Steps>
  1. Find the green run button in the top right corner of the flow
  2. Click the button to run the flow
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img src="./assets/run-button.png" alt="Run Button" />
</Frame>

After running, you should see something like this:

<Frame>
  <img src="./assets/simple-flow-after-run.png" alt="Simple Flow After Run" />
</Frame>

<Callout type="info">
  When you run the flow, the text block sends its content to the chat block. The chat block then uses AI to process this text and generate a response.
</Callout>

## Experimenting with the Flow

To modify a block's settings, click the edit gear icon in the top right corner of the block.

<Accordion title="Try These Experiments">
  <AccordionItem title="Change the Question">
    1. Edit the text block
    2. Type a new question like "What's the difference between a NDA and a MNDA?"
    3. Run the flow again
    4. Observe how the chat block responds with new information
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Adjust Max Tokens">
    1. Edit the chat block
    2. Change the max tokens to 256
    3. Run the flow again
    4. Notice how the response is shorter
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Modify Temperature">
    1. Edit the chat block
    2. Set the temperature to 1
    3. Run the flow again
    4. Observe how the responses become more varied
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

By experimenting with these settings, you can see how different parameters affect the AI's responses in your workflow.
