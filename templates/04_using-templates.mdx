## Using Your Templates for Automated Document Generation

Once you've created and published your templates, Odella's intelligent Template Agent takes over to handle all aspects of document population and generation. The Template Agent is a sophisticated AI system that can be integrated directly into workflows or power your AI employees to automatically populate templates with the right information from any available source.

## Template Agent Overview

The Template Agent is Odella's core intelligence for template management and document generation. It acts as an autonomous system that:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Information Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Automatically searches through connected applications, databases, and provided files to find the information needed to populate template fields.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Interaction Management" icon="comments">
    Intelligently asks users for missing information when needed, using context-aware questions based on the template requirements and available data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Source Data Integration" icon="link">
    Seamlessly pulls information from various sources including CRM systems, document repositories, email systems, and other connected business applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Processing" icon="file-text">
    Reads and extracts relevant information from uploaded documents, transcribes audio files, and processes various file formats to gather template data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Two Primary Integration Methods

The Template Agent can be utilized in two powerful ways to streamline your document generation processes:

### 1. Direct Workflow Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Template Block to Workflow">
    In your workflow builder, add a "Populate Template" block at any stage where document generation is needed. Select your published template from the dropdown menu of available templates.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Data Sources">
    Connect the Template Agent to relevant data sources for this workflow step. This can include previous workflow outputs, connected applications, uploaded files, or user input forms.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Information Gathering Rules">
    Configure how the Template Agent should handle missing information - whether to search connected systems first, ask the user immediately, or use default values when appropriate.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Output Actions">
    Specify what happens with the generated document - save to a specific location, email to recipients, attach to a case file, or pass to the next workflow step.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. AI Employee Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign Templates to AI Employees">
    Attach one or more templates to your AI employees through the AI employee configuration interface. Each AI employee can have access to multiple templates for different document types.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Usage Context">
    Configure when and how the AI employee should use each template by providing context rules, trigger conditions, and decision-making criteria for template selection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Autonomous Generation">
    Set up the AI employee to automatically generate documents when specific conditions are met, such as case milestones, client requests, or scheduled deadlines.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Review Processes">
    Establish review and approval workflows for AI-generated documents, including automatic routing to appropriate staff members for final review.
  </Step>
</Steps>
