## How It Works

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="Public Datasets">
    Lawme provides access to a wealth of public legal data, harnessing the power of LLMs to help your team retrieve information for drafting, research, or compliance quickly and accurately. These public datasets are continually updated to ensure you have the latest legal information at your fingertips.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Custom Document Vaults">
    If your firm has unique datasets or specific legal documents, you can create custom vaults. These vaults allow you to store sensitive data securely while enabling quick access for document drafting, case research, or client reports. By linking your vaults to specific workflows, you ensure that relevant data is always readily available when needed.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title="Integrating with Workflows">
    Your Document Store is more than just a repositoryâ€”it's deeply integrated with Lawme's workflow automation. This integration enables you to link specific datasets or vaults directly to workflows, automating routine tasks such as pulling relevant clauses from past contracts, performing legal research, or generating reports based on previous legal outcomes.

</Accordion>

## Setting Up Your Document Store

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Vault">
    Navigate to the Document Store tab in the platform, and click "Create New Vault." From here, you can upload your firm's important documents, such as contracts, compliance records, or client reports, into a secure, searchable vault.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign to Workflows">
    Once your vault is set up, link it to relevant workflows to automate tasks like contract drafting, legal research, or regulatory compliance checks. This ensures that every time a task requires specific documents or data, the system retrieves it automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Access and Security">
    Maintain control over who can access and edit specific vaults by setting user permissions. With role-based access controls, you can ensure that sensitive documents remain secure and are only available to authorized team members.
  </Step>
</Steps>
