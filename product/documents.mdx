## Setting Up Your AI-Powered Document Store

    Begin by navigating to the Document Store tab and selecting "Create New Vault." In this step, provide essential details:
    
    - **Name**: Give your document store a clear, descriptive name.
    - **Subtitle**: Add a brief subtitle for additional context.
    - **Description**: Describe the purpose of this store and the types of documents it will contain, helping users understand its intended use.

    Once these fields are completed, click "Next Step" to proceed with configuring your vault.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an AI Model">
    Select one of four available AI models, each with unique capabilities and pricing, to process and analyse your documents in the way that best suits your needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Document Store Columns">
    Customize the fields that will be extracted from your documents. Choose from an existing template or create a custom column structure from scratch. 
    <Note>
      Once columns are created, they cannot be modified. Plan your column structure carefully.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add and Manage Documents">
    After setting up your columns, upload documents to the vault. The system will automatically extract information based on your column setup, enabling easy retrieval and management of document metadata.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Tip>
  Once your vault is set up, you can integrate it with your workflows. This integration allows Lawme's AI to access and utilise relevant information as needed, enhancing its utility in your daily processes.
