# Workflows Overview

<Callout type="info">
  At the heart of Lawme lies its workflows—the engine that powers your virtual assistants and automates routine legal tasks.
</Callout>

Workflows connect the dots, automating everything from research to document drafting, while your team focuses on delivering high-value legal work. Each assistant in Lawme has access to public workflows for common tasks, as well as custom workflows tailored specifically to your firm.

## Why Workflows Matter

Workflows are the backbone of your legal operations in Lawme. They handle repetitive tasks, ensure consistency, and allow your assistants to respond quickly and accurately.

## Designing Your Workflows

Workflows in Lawme are flexible and customisable, allowing you to shape how legal tasks are performed:

1. **Pre-Built Workflows**  
   Access a library of ready-made workflows for common legal tasks. These public workflows provide immediate value by automating tasks like legal research, compliance checks, and document generation.

2. **Custom Workflows**  
   Tailor your workflows to suit your firm's unique needs. With Lawme's Workflow Builder, you can design workflows from scratch, incorporating your specific templates, documents, and legal requirements.

## Integrating Workflows with Assistants

Your virtual assistants rely on workflows to handle the tasks they're assigned:

<Callout type="tip">
  Use workflows to automate tasks like drafting documents, performing legal research, or managing client queries. Custom workflows ensure tasks are handled according to your specific legal requirements and operational standards.
</Callout>

## Workflow in Action

Lawme's workflows aren't just static sequences—they interact dynamically with your firm's operations:

- **Efficient Task Routing**: Automatically assign tasks to the appropriate assistant based on their role.
- **Data-Driven**: Workflows can pull from your document store, using metadata extraction and AI-driven insights to enhance accuracy and speed.

## Running, Pausing, and Managing Workflows

From the **Action Bar**, you have full control over your workflows:
