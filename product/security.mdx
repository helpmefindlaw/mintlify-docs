# Security Overview

At Lawme.AI, we understand the critical importance of security in the legal industry. Our platform is designed to provide configurable, enterprise-grade security tailored to meet your firm's specific needs. We ensure full control and confidentiality at every step, offering flexibility and peace of mind while safeguarding client data throughout the entire process.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Configurable Protection

Our configurable protection features allow you to customize security settings to align with your firm's requirements:

- **Customisable Security Settings**: Control and adjust security settings by enabling or disabling any of the 13 model providers from the settings page. This granular control ensures that you can tailor the platform's security to your specific needs.

- **Model Selection**: We provide key term summaries for each model, allowing you to review and select models that best match your firm's specific requirements. This ensures that you're always using models that align with your security standards.

- **Data Residency Controls**: Protect your client data with fully configurable data residency settings. These controls offer you complete authority over where your data is stored and processed, ensuring compliance with local regulations and client expectations.

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Security

Our enterprise-grade security features are designed to meet the stringent requirements of legal firms:

- **Advanced Security Settings**: Similar to our configurable protection features, you have control over advanced security settings. This includes the ability to disable any of the 13 model providers, giving you precise control over which AI models interact with your data.

- **Data Protection**: We prioritize the protection of sensitive client information. By allowing you to select models with suitable protection measures in place, we ensure that your firm's data handling aligns with industry best practices and your specific needs.

- **Data Residency Compliance**: Our configurable options ensure your firm adheres to data residency regulations. This not only maintains legal compliance but also helps in building and maintaining client trust by demonstrating your commitment to data sovereignty.

### 3. Sandbox Environment

During our Closed Pilot Program, we offer a secure sandbox environment for testing and exploration:

- **Secure Testing Environment**: Explore and test the platform within a controlled, secure sandbox. This allows you to evaluate workflows, features, and security measures without risking sensitive data.

- **Workflow Testing**: Safely trial new features and automate tasks in this sandbox environment. You can be confident that your confidential data remains uncompromised throughout the testing process, allowing for thorough evaluation before implementation in your live environment.
